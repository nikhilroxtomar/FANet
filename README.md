## Abstract
Recently,  deep learning based medical image analysis,particularly, biomedical image segmentation has attractedsubstantial  attention  in  the  computer  vision  community.Even  though  convolutional  neural  networks  have  shownprogress, there still exists unleashed opportunities for im-provement.  While, current networks focus on a systematicone-way epoch wise training, predictions from the previousepoch remains unexplored.  In this work, we leverage eachepoch information to prune the prediction maps of the sub-sequent training epoch.  In this context, we propose a newarchitecture  called  feedback  attention  network  “FANet”that unifies the previous epoch mask with the feature mapof the current epoch, similar to a recurrent learning mech-anism, which is then used to provide a hard-attention to thelearnt feature maps at different convolution layers. We showthat our proposed feedback-attention model provides a sub-stantial improvement for most segmentation metrics on pub-licly available biomedical imaging datasets
